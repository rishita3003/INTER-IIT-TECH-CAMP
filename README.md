# INTER-IIT-TECH-CAMP Project
The Quantitative Problem Statement (Quant PS) developed for the Inter IIT Tech Camp at IIT Guwahati focused on exploring and implementing the Pair Trading Strategy. This strategy is an integral part of statistical arbitrage and is widely utilized in quantitative finance due to its efficacy and theoretical backing.

## Overview
The INTER-IIT-TECH-CAMP project focuses on the Quantitative Problem Statement (Quant PS) released for the Inter IIT Tech Camp hosted by IIT Guwahati, emphasizing the Pair Trading Strategy. This strategy is a key component of financial engineering and quantitative finance.

## Key Concepts Implemented
This project involves practical implementations of various sophisticated concepts within the realm of statistical arbitrage. Here are some of the key areas covered:

- **Statistical Arbitrage**: Utilizing price inefficiencies between paired stocks to secure profits.
- **Kalman Filter**: A mathematical algorithm to estimate hidden states from inaccurate measurements, crucial for predicting stock price movements accurately.
- **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**: Represents the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified time period, adjusted for compounding.
- **Z-Score**: A statistical measurement describing the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean population.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Indicates the average return minus the risk-free return divided by the standard deviation of return on an investment.
- **P-Value Comparisons**: Assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis, helping in the validation of the stock pairs selected for trading.

## Practical Applications
The practical applications demonstrated in this project include:

- **Cointegration Comparison**: Analyzing different pairs of stocks to evaluate their cointegration, which is essential for identifying pairs most likely to revert to the mean.
- **Selection of Reliable Trading Pairs**: Using the statistical tools and concepts implemented to choose the best pairs that potentially reduce risk and increase profitability.

The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks that detail these implementations, providing a hands-on approach to learning and understanding these complex concepts.
